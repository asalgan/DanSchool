    <h4>Innovation and The Right People</h4>
    <p class="blog-content col-md-10">
      From the first skyscraper built in 1884, to one of the largest and most innovative tech incubators, 1871, Chicago has always been a city known for innovation. While modestly flaunting one of the most picturesque skylines in the world, Chicagoans know that there is a lot more than what meets the eye. Among the array of 80 story buildings, congested streets filled with honking commuters, and the crazy weather, there are people who challenge the status quo. Within the past few years, Chicago’s entrepreneurial and tech communities have become the center of attention around the United States and the world. Ever heard of that small start-up called Groupon? Six years ago, it didn’t exist; today they boast over 10,000 employees.
    </p>

    <h4 class="col-md-offset-2">Room to Grow</h4>
    <p class="blog-content col-md-10 col-md-offset-2">
      Chicago is a city that has a lot of room to grow. Though we may oversee some of our city’s “less attractive attributes” due to our pride, there is much that we can do to make Chicago and Chicagoland a better place to live. For example, before Divvy, we didn’t have a real bike transportation system. Though Divvy made it easy for people to rent a bike, Chicago still needs innovative entrepreneurs to design paths, create destinations, and build technology to compliment the conveniences and inconveniences of bike travel.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-content col-md-10 col-md-offset-2">
      Another example of how Chicago has grown to be a city of uncompromising standards is through the food-scene. A decade ago, Chicago was limited when it came to food. Today, Chicago boasts a food scene comparable to New York, Paris, or Los Angeles. With restaurants such as Alinea, which was rated one of the best restaurants in the world, Chicago continues to surprise us. But much to our surprise, Chicago still lacks a large variety of bakeries, “Mom & Pop shops”, fresh foods in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, locally sourced foods, and more. Entrepreneurs and leaders must fuel positive change as a city continues to evolve. With Course Pioneer, students will learn to identify a problem and try to create a solution for it.

    <p class="blog-content col-md-10 col-md-offset-2">
      The world needs entrepreneurs; so we set out to help teenage students find their passion at a young age. We know that you can’t just “teach” entrepreneurship; that is why we are building a set of courses which complement one another through hard and soft business skills. Each class is built through first-hand experiences and a clear understanding of the difficulties that entrepreneurs and business leaders face. We don't take the “traditional” route of sitting in front of the projector for hours- we work and collaborate amongst our group in order to understand how team-building works.

    <h4>What is Course Pioneer?</h4>
    <p class="blog-content col-md-10">
      Course Pioneer is a new and innovative program that focuses on instructing and guiding 
      business and entrepreneurially minded teens and pre-teens to make them more competitive among 
      their peers. Through small class sizes, specialized mentorship, and a results-focused program, Course 
      Pioneer aims to sharpen core skills which allow students to become either entrepreneurs, or leaders in 
      their fields.
    </p>
    <h4 class="col-md-offset-2">About the founder:</h4>

    <p class="blog-content col-md-10 col-md-offset-2">
      Dan Salganik, the founder of Course Pioneer, is a recent college graduate with a history of starting 
      businesses. From his first small-scale t-shirt business that he started in high-school, to FunderHut, an 
      online community fundraising platform raising thousands of dollars through successful projects, Dan 
      has been able to take what he has learned and apply it to his teaching. Dan has spent years learning and 
      training to teach a wide variety of students in a way that goes beyond just pen and paper. He has also 
      spoken at numerous panels, conferences, and events with attendance in the hundreds.
      Dan has many unique ideas and is enthusiastic about the growth of his program. He plans to expand by 
      adding more locations and hiring more specialized teachers. He also wants to create a way to eventually 
      get students, as well as small business owners, connected to one another.
    </p>

    <h4 class="col-md-offset-2">The Vision:</h4>

    <p class="blog-content col-md-10 col-md-offset-2">
      The vision is to create a community of young entrepreneurs that will be connected through our 
      program. As we grow as a company, the plan will be to launch more classes that offer a unique array of 
      hard and soft skills. This is just the ground floor and there is much more to come.
    </p>

    <h4 class="col-md-offset-2">The Goal:</h4>

    <p class="blog-content col-md-10 col-md-offset-2">
      The goal of Course Pioneer is to offer business-related classes that are typically not offered in junior 
      high and high school, such as Entrepreneurship, Public Speaking, and Social Enterprise. Each class in the 
      Course Pioneer program will offer a unique set of skills taught by a college student or young professional 
      that is highly specialized in their field. The goal is to have the class be relatable to the younger students 
      by a mentor/teacher that understands the trends and interactions of the students.
    </p>

    <h4 class="col-md-offset-2">The Courses:</h4>

    <p class="blog-content col-md-10 col-md-offset-2">
      Course Pioneer classes will feature a unique hands-on lesson plan that not only teaches students, but 
      gets them thinking. The goal of the classes will be to get students to go beyond what they learn in the 
      classroom and apply it in a real world setting.
      Classes such as the entrepreneurship course will not only teach students the essential skills that they 
      need to know when coming up with or launching a business, but will also teach them about unique 
      trends, how to build a business from an idea, reaching the customer, understanding failure, thinking 
      outside the box, social responsibility, and much more. Public speaking is a course built around getting 
      students comfortable speaking amongst their peers. Through many exercises, speeches, improvisation 
      games, and gradual learning methods, students should find themselves more comfortable speaking 
      in front of colleagues. Social Enterprise focuses on building a stronger community through socially 
      responsible non-profits and for-profits. We will explore the sustainability model of triple bottom line, 
      visit unique non-profits, and hear from the founders themselves to see what they did to become 
      successful in their endeavors.
      Most Course Pioneer classes build up to a final “project” or presentation which is later presented as a 
      graduation to the course. Family of the students, as well as local business owners are welcome to take 
      part in the accomplishments of the students by watching as they present what they learned.
